MODULE MANAGER
    - Call a function to update ids of json. {moduleCreatorId : "adsfadfadf", "adsfadfadf" : ""}
    - Be able to add from sections and remove from cells.
    - Hide and show sections and add left margin on subsections.
    OPTION 1
    - All the sections and cells from the module path will keep a reference map on the module manager class, this reference will be udpated everytime we add o remove a section or a cell.
    OPTIOIN 2 : easier
    - Views will have an interface to get either the module data or section from the modules manager.
    - Actually the connection can be made to be back and forth between the module manager, menu viewer and the views.


# VIEWS:

    - We need to asign a view to each part of the module.
        - we will have a view lists with routes.
        - once we select a view we will load that on the center view. 
    - We will use the route to select the type of view we want.
    - We need to be able to select and open the view from the modules menu. 
    - Put all the settings of module section data and module data on the module itself.

#NOTES: 

    - Notes will float around the whole website if we select them. we will be able to resize them and move them around.
    - There will be a basic Note system that will allow you to add text, js code and images. You will be able to edit the text: size, font width. Image: change its size.
